        <p>Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny<br>
        Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
        Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name, and money<br>
        And the town said "How did a middle class divorcée do it?"</p>
        <p>The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
        There's only so far new money goes<br>
        They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"<br>
        Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
        The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
        It must have been her fault his heart gave out</p>
        <p class="chorus"><span class="and">And they said </span> <span class="wavy">"There goes the last great American dynasty"</span><br>
        Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been<br>
        <span class="light">There goes the <span class="mad">maddest</span> woman this town has ever seen</span><br>
        She had a marvelous time ruining everything</p>
        <p>Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever<br>
        Flew in all the Bitch Pack friends from the city<br>
        Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names><br>
        And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
        And losing on card game bets with Dalí</p>
        <p class="chorus"><span class="and">And they said </span><span class="wavy">"There goes the last great American dynasty"</span><br>
        Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
        <span class="light">There goes the most <span class="shameless">shameless</span> woman this town has ever seen</span><br>
        She had a marvelous time ruining everything</p>
        <p>They say she was seen on occasion<br>
        Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea<br>
        And in a feud with her neighbor<br>
        She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
        Fifty years is a long time<br>
        Holiday House sat quietly on that beach<br>
        Free of women with madness<br>
        Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me</p>
        <p>Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been<br>
        There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
        I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
        I had a marvelous time<br>
        <span class="one">Ruining everything</span><br> 
        <span class="two">A marvelous time</span><br>
        <span class="three">Ruining everything</span><br>
        <span class="four">A marvelous time</span><br>
        <span class="five">I had a marvelous time</span></p>
