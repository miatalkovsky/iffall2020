        <p>Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was <em class="sunny">sunny</em><br>
        Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
        Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name, and money<br>
        And the town said "How did a middle class divorcée do it?"</p>
        <p class="first">The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
        There's only so far new money goes<br>
        They picked out a home and called it "<span class="holiday">Holiday House</span>"<br>
        Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
        The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
        It must have been her fault his heart gave out</p>
        <p class="chorus-margin"><span class="chorus">And they said </span> "There goes the last great American dynasty"<br>
        Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been<br>
        There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
        She had a marvelous time ruining everything</p>
        <p class="first">Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever<br>
        Flew in all the Bitch Pack friends from the city<br>
        Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the <span class="big">big names</span><br>
        And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
        And losing on card game bets with Dalí</p>
        <p class="chorus-margin"><span class="chorus">And they said </span>"There goes the last great American dynasty"<br>
        Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
        There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen<br>
        She had a marvelous time ruining everything</p>
        <p class="first">They say she was seen on occasion<br>
        Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea<br>
        And in a feud with her neighbor<br>
        She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
        Fifty years is a <span class="long">long</span>time<br>
        <span class="holiday">Holiday House</span> sat quietly on that beach<br>
        Free of women with madness<br>
        Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me</p>
        <p class="first">Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been<br>
        There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
        I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
        I had a marvelous time<br>
        Ruining everything<br> 
        A marvelous time<br>
        Ruining everything<br>
        A marvelous time<br>
        I had a marvelous time</p>
