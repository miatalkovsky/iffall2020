		<p class="description">French toast is probably my favorite breakfast food! There are tons of creative ways to make this recipe, but they all start with this classic and delicious base. Personally, I love to use thick slices of Challah for my bread and top with fresh fruit for a nice weekend breakfast or brunch.</p>
